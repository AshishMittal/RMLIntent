# Representation based meta learning for spoken intent recognition

In this repository we share the meta learning split used for Google Speech Commands dataset[1] and Fluent Speech Commands dataset[2] used in our paper.

We share split for two variants 
(i) SPO - where the classes in validation/test set do not overlap with the training set, but speakers do overlap.
(ii) No-SPO - where the classes and speakers in validation/test set do not overlap with the traininng set.
